    <slide title="GIT Repositories" layout="normal">
        <p>Throughout this lab, and indeed this course, frequent mention is made of
            "github repositories". The course hub, and *all* of the starter and example projects
            are stored on github.com.</p>
        <p>
            <b>This is an off-campus resource, and the BCIT privacy policies
                apply.</b>
        </p>
        <p>Your work is to be completed in a public GIT repository,
            but you have choices for this:
            <ul>
                <li>Use github.com voluntarily, possibly with an alias account name
                    if you have privacy concerns</li>
                <li>Use git.cit.bcit.ca, a Gitlab server on campus</li>
                <li>Use a private repo on bitbucket.com or the GIT server of your choice,
                and add me as a collaborator</li>
            </ul>
        </p>        
        <p>Whenever you read the term "github repository" in connection
            with your work, interpret that as whatever GIT repository you are using!</p>
