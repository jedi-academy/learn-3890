# Session 2 - Prep
ACIT3890 - BCIT - Fall 2019

## Lesson Prep?

When I first put this course together, licensing looked more complicated.
Industry has settled on three main licenses, however, which suit
all but the most complicated situations: Apache 2, GPL3, and MIT.

Github has tried to make it easy, with their [license chooser](https://choosealicense.com/).

The only "prep" you need for today's session is a general awareness of licensing, which you should have.
