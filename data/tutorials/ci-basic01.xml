        <p>This tutorial will walk you through converting a static HTML
            website into a CodeIgniter webapp.</p>
        <p>The approach taken is not the only one possible, or even the best one,
            but it suits "baby steps".</p>
              
        <p>Suggestion: you may want to skim the slideshow first,
            before working your way through it.</p>

    <slide title="Get The Starter" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Fork the 
                <a href="https://github.com/jedi-academy/starter-gallery" target="_blank">tutorial starter</a>
                project, and clone it to your local system.
            </p>
            <p>Wherever you clone this to, make sure that your virtual host mapping
				references the project's <code>public</code> folder, and has a <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code>
				element if needed. 
				I show "gallery.local" or "comp4711.local" in the screenshots following,
			depending on when I took the screenshots.</p>
			<p>You will download a CodeIgniter starter as well, a few slides from now.
			It, however, can be discarded once its contents have been merged with
			your lab starter.</p>

    <slide title="What Do You Have?" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>I cloned my gallery starter project to a "my-lab03" folder on my system,
				and created a new NetBeans project (with existing sources) from it.</p>
				<p>The screenshots that follow use NetBeans, but you are free to use
					the IDE and folder of your choice. Remember to <code>git ignore</code>
				the IDE metadata folder inside your local repository.</p>
                <p>You should see a <code>public</code> folder, which contains an entire
                static website.</p>

    </slide>

    <slide title="What Does It Look Like?" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Assuming that your new project is mapped to "comp4711.local",
                then the URL "comp4711.local" should give you the
                homepage of the static site, shown right.</p>  
                <p>Don't forget to include the port you assigned to Apache in the
                URL, if yours is other than 80.</p>          
        </div>

    <slide title="How Do We Make This Into a Webapp?" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>The basic steps we will follow are shown to the right.
                This tutorial will address the first two steps, and
                each of the next two tutorials will address two additional
                steps.
            </p>
            <p>This isn't the only way to do this job, but is one
                that makes sense. After each stage of the conversion,
                we should still have a working site.</p>
            <p>Er, it will behave like it is working, even though
                it won't be a proper webapp until we are done.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
            <ol>
                <li>Copy our CI starter into our project</li>
                <li>Do a trivial conversion</li>
                <li>Setup base controller and view template</li>                    
                <li>Fix the pages to use these</li>
                <li>Add a model</li>
                <li>Revisit the pages</li>
            </ol>

    <slide title="Copy Our CI Starter" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Download and extract the <a href="https://github.com/jedi-academy/CodeIgniter3.1-starter2" target="_blank">
				CodeIgniter starter project</a>, and copy its application, public 
				and system folders into your lab project folder. </p>
			<p>Your file manager will ask if it is ok to merge the folders, since your
				lab 3 project already has a public folder.
				That is fine, as there should be no overlap between them.</p>
            <p>Now, asking for comp4711.local in your browser should
                give you the "Welcome to CodeIgniter!" page, because of
				the presence of CodeIgniter's <code>index.php</code> in
				the document root.</p>

    <slide title="Create Trivial Controllers" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Our static site has 3 pages: index.html, gallery.html
                and about.html. We can make trivial controllers for each of these,
                which simply load the corresponding "view".</p>
				<p>Fix <code>application/controllers/Welcome.php</code> (your homepage)
                to load the "welcome" view, instead of the "welcome_message"
				one.</p>
				<p>Create similar controllers Gallery.php and About.php,
                which load the "gallery" and "about" views, respectively.</p>
				<p>
					<b>Note:</b> Our controller extends <code>Application</code>
					(our base controller), though we are not using the
					template parser. We will do that in the
					next tutorial ... baby steps, remember?

    <slide title="Create Trivial Views" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>We can make trivial views for each of the static pages,
				by copying the static html files to our <code>application/views</code>
                folder, and renaming them to have a ".php" extension.
				Note that <code>index.html</code> would become <code>welcome.php</code>.</p>     
            <p>You may have to rename these using your file manager,
                if your IDE won't let you change the extension.</p>      
				<p>We no longer need the <code>views/welcome_message.php</code>
                that came with the CI starter.</p>

    <slide title="Fix Our Menu" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Yay, our site *looks* better, but what about the menu? It still
                refers to the original HTML files. 
				Fix this by changing the menu links to refer to our CI controllers
                instead. Apply this change to each of our three views.
				These menu links will be found inside the <code>header</code> div
			of each view file.</p>
            <p>Notice that the homepage is referred to as just "/", and that
                each of the other references start with a slash.</p>

     <slide title="Are We There Yet?" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>So far, so good ... the website looks the same as the original,
            but it has been partially transformed into a (trivial) CodeIgniter webapp.</p>
            <p>The next tutorial will take the website to the next level.</p>
            <p>This would be an appropriate point to commit and push your local changes
            to your github repo. One of your teammates will complete the next tutorial.</p>
