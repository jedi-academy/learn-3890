#Lab #9 - RESTful Client & Server
COMP4711 - BCIT - Fall 2017

##Lab Goals

The purpose of this lab is to take a working webapp, 
the Todo List Manager, and split it into two
parts which talk to each other using RESTful distributed system techniques.

#Flash News

I was working on the lab writeup, having you setup a RESTful resource
controller, and it wasn't working out well.

It finally dawned on me that this can't be a resource controller,
because all our magic is done in the `load()` and `store()` methods.

Arghhh.

I need to rewrite the lab, and we will do it next week instead,
together with the simple authentication I have planned.

Michal & I will be in lab today to answer any questions you have.
We will not be taking attendance today :-/
