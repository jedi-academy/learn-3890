# Hello - Team Introductions
COMP4711 - BCIT - Winter 2019

## Lab Goals

This is an opportunity for each team to provide me some background about their
projects, and not a lab for marks.

I have made some team groups on D2L.
The members of each team should signup for the same group,
and the team leader (or delegate) should provide a one page
project writeup.

## Writeup Contents

- team name
- project name (if different)
- project description; one or two sentences
- describe the resources you plan to provide a RESTful endpoint for
(or the top two if you have more than that)
- describe the services you plan to provide an API endpoint for
(or the top two if you have more)
- provide the URL of any team repository you are already using

Writeup format: text, markdown, Word, PDF
## Lab Submission

Submit your writeup to the "team intro" dropbox by Sunday Jan 13th, 17:30 PST
