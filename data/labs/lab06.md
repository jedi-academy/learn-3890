#Lab #6 - Building Out Our TODO List Manager
COMP4711 - BCIT - Winter 2018

##Lab Goals

The purpose of this lab is to "build out" our TODO list webapp
from last lab,
by adding some useful functionality pieces, culminating in role-based CRUD.
The CRUD maintenance will be implemented by generating suitable HTML
forms for TODO tasks, and handling the input from them.

The lab will build on the last one (lab 5). If your lab 5 has issues,
they should be fixed before starting this lab.

We will continue to use gitflow workflow. That means proper branching (master/develop), 
completing new work in feature branches, and good commit comments.
Generally speaking, I am happy with the gitflow practices I have seen.
We will continue to award marks for them to help you remember
these practices :)

##Lab Teams & Repo

Use the same "Lab 5-7" team as for the last lab.

##Lab Submission

Your lab will result in an updated github repository for your team.

Submit a readme *text* file, or a submission comment, to the lab dropbox. 
It should contain a link to your **team**'s github repository. 

**Note:** this is not a cloning URL, and I do not need links to the individual
team member repos.

Due: Sunday Mar 4 by 17:30.

##Lab Marking Guideline

A marking rubric will be attached to the lab 6 dropboxes, similar to our
earlier labs. The labs will be weighted equally in the marks worksheet,
even if some of them have different raw scores because of their rubric.

##Github repository

In your github repo, make sure that everything has been merged into your
*master* branch before starting this lab, so that your *develop* branch
is "clean". 

At the end of the lab, you will merge *develop* into *master* again, to
reflect the new deployable webapp state.

##Your jobs

There are six small jobs to do to complete the lab. I suggest that you switch
team members for each.

- [Job 6 - Pagination](/display/tutorial/ci-todo06)
- [Job 7 - User roles](/display/tutorial/ci-todo07)
- [Job 8 - Add "completion" to the Homepage](/display/tutorial/ci-todo08)
- [Job 9 - Beef up the maintenance page](/display/tutorial/ci-todo09)
- [Job 10 - Add item maintenance (finally)](/display/tutorial/ci-todo10)
- [Job 11 - Polish the item maintenance](/display/tutorial/ci-todo11)

Some of the jobs can be done in parallel, but you would end up
with some team members familiar with some of the techniques but
not all of them.

Note: a working version of this is deployed at https://todo.jlparry.com :-/

Note 2: The UX/UI for our item maintenance is pretty tragic,
but our focus is on functionality.

#Wrapup

<div class="alert alert-info">
Captain: assuming that everyone on the team agrees that
you have completed the lab, prepare for submission.

It is now time
to merge the *develop* branch into the *master* branch,
and submit your repo link to the dropbox!!
