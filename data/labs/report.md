#Week #8 - Investigative Report
COMP4711 - BCIT - Fall 2017

There are a number of tools, emerging technologies and issues relevant to webapp 
development, but out of the scope of our course.

I have identified 51 of them, that would suit the investigative report
I had in mind for you to do in place of a midterm, but that isn't enough
for all of you, and the intent was for individual efforts :(

It is a sad, sad day :'(

I am cancelling the report, and will adjust the course grades accordingly.
All of the other grade components will add up to 90, and the final percentage
will be calculated from that.

Study wisely for your other midterms next week!
