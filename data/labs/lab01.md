(1 small, 1 medium, 1 large).

## Lab Tasks

For each of your projects, prepare a formatted JSON document,
using the template in the [lab repo](https://github.com/jim-parry/3890-lab02), and named after the

No duplicate projects allowed, across the set. The repo has a list of the
projects spoken for, which I will update as we go.
