# Lab #2 - Open Source Licensing
ACIT3890 - BCIT - Fall 2019

## Lab Goals

Explain the MongoDB licensing dramas, 2018-2019, in a digestible form.

## Lab Process

Gather round the campfire...

1. Introduction (me) ... 30 mins
2. Reading (you) ... 30 mins
3. Group discussion & initial findings ... 45 mins
4. Progress report - 2-3 minutes per group ... 15 mins
5. Refine & polish submission ... 30 mins

## Lab Tasks

You will be investigating the afore-mentioned dramas, and preparing
part of what will become a case study writeup, initially available
through the course hub.

The case study will be split into five sections:
- story - what happened? why?
- SSPL - what is this? tell me more
- how are they right - 2 or 3 main points
- how are they wrong - 2 or 3 main points
- lessons to learn - 2 or 3 "morals"

Each section will have a team submission, of 1-3 text paragraphs each
(markdown format, in case you wish to include links). These will be used 
to form the assembled case study report, separate from the lab itself.

## Lab Teams

The class will be split into 5 groups of three.

Group composition will be discussed in lab - you should wait until then to join 
the appropriate group.

## Lab Submission

Submit your section text to the lab 2 dropbox.
This is a group lab.

Due: Weds, Sept 11, 16:30 PST

## Lab Marking Guideline

The lab has a rubric associated with it.

## Post Lab...

I will share the case study report.
