#Job 6 - Pagination

So far, our maintenance item list is presentable as is, because it is small.
This will change as the work load piles up :-/

The solution - add pagination to the item list.

"Pagination" means being able to show a "page" worth of items at a time,
with navigation to show the previous or next page, and the first or
last page. 

Codeigniter has a 
[Pagination Class](https://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/pagination.html) 
to make this "easier", but I have found it overkill and not always a good fit.
Let's roll our own :)

##6.1 Pagination basics

We need to specify how many items go on a page. This should be a property in our
`Mtce` controller, set at the top of the class body. 

	private $items_per_page = 10;

The page # to display will end up
being a parameter passed as a URL segment.

We should then have a method to display a set of items.
Pagination can then be done by extracting the proper items,
creating the navlinks for that, and then displaying
the relevant set of items.

Let's refactor our `index` method, having it pass the entire task list
to a `show_page` method.

Extract the task presentation from `index` into a new method `page`,
which takes the tasks to display as a parameter...

	public function index()
	{
		$tasks = $this->tasks->all(); // get all the tasks
		$this->show_page($tasks);
	}

	// Show a single page of todo items
	private function show_page($tasks)
	{
		$this->data['pagetitle'] = 'TODO List Maintenance';
		// build the task presentation output
		$result = ''; // start with an empty array		
		foreach ($tasks as $task)
		{
			if (!empty($task->status))
				$task->status = $this->app->status($task->status);
			$result .= $this->parser->parse('oneitem', (array) $task, true);
		}
		$this->data['display_tasks'] = $result;

		// and then pass them on
		$this->data['pagebody'] = 'itemlist';
		$this->render();
	}

The `show_page` method is private, so that it cannot be directly referenced
from the browser.

You can test your webapp now.

So far, there is no apparent difference in the output. We need to refactor a bit
so that we extract only the tasks of interest.

##6.2 Item page extraction

Let's make a `page` method, with the desired page # as a parameter.
This is intended to be callable from the browser, so it will be public.

It will need to extract `items_per-page` tasks, from the proper starting point.

The starting point will be the page # less 1, times the # of items per page.

For instance, page "3" will contain 10 items, starting from task 21 (if numbered from 1).

	// Extract & handle a page of items, defaulting to the beginning
	function page($num = 1)
	{
		$records = $this->tasks->all(); // get all the tasks
		$tasks = array(); // start with an empty extract
		
		// use a foreach loop, because the record indices may not be sequential
		$index = 0; // where are we in the tasks list
		$count = 0; // how many items have we added to the extract
		$start = ($num - 1) * $this->items_per_page;
		foreach($records as $task) {
			if ($index++ >= $start) {
				$tasks[] = $task;
				$count++;
			}
			if ($count >= $this->items_per_page) break;
		}
		$this->show_page($tasks);
	}

Try it ... in your location field, pass "/mtce/page/2" after your domain name.
You should see items 11 through 15.

Do you see what's coming? Our `index` method can be simplified even further:

	public function index()
	{
		$this->page(1);
	}

Everything should still work, with the output being pretty much the same as before,
but only showing a single "page" of tasks.

##6.3 Pagination navigation

For the pagination navigation mentioned at the beginning of this tutorial, we just need to 
calculate the correct starting page number for each of the four links,
and then build & style a navbar for these.

The pagination navbar can come pretty much from the Bootstrap docs.
Let's make ours `views/itemnav.php` ...

    <ul class="nav nav-pills">
            <li><a href="/mtce/page/{first}">First</a></li>
            <li><a href="/mtce/page/{previous}">Previous</a></li>
            <li><a href="/mtce/page/{next}">Next</a></li>
            <li><a href="/mtce/page/{last}">Last</a></li>
    </ul>

We can add this to the top of our `itemlist` view ...

    {pagination}
    <table class="table">
            <tr>
                    <th>Id</th>
                    <th>Task</th>
                    <th>Status</th>
            </tr>
            {display_tasks}
    </table>

Now all we have to do is calculate the appropriate page numbers, and
create the view parameter for this.

We should add a method inside `Mtce` to do this.

	// Build the pagination navbar
	private function pagenav($num) {
		$lastpage = ceil($this->tasks->size() / $this->items_per_page);
		$parms = array(
			'first' => 1,
			'previous' => (max($num-1,1)),
			'next' => min($num+1,$lastpage),
			'last' => $lastpage
		);
		return $this->parser->parse('itemnav',$parms,true);
	}


And we can then insert a call to that method inside our `page` method...

                ...
		$this->data['pagination'] = $this->pagenav($num);
		$this->show_page($tasks);
	}

You should now see a functional pagination navbar at the top of the maintenance
item list :)
