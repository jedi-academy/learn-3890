## Course description
This course provides the students with the skills needed to participate in open 
source projects, and to collaborate on software development within and between organizations. 
This is applicable to all four of the CIT skill areas - infrastructure, enterprise 
software, web services and user support. Anyone can use free and open source 
technology, but you need appropriate knowledge, mindset and skillset to 
contribute to and to leverage these technologies. This course takes the 
student through those, having them progress from participating in a controlled 
open source project through to contributing to a real & live one. 

## Course goals
Hands-on experience with open source (OS):

- contribution to a controlled OS project
- setup & contribution to an experimental OS project
- contribution to a live external OS project
 

## Course learning outcomes / competencies
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:  

- Describe open source software, its practices and its processes.
- Describe open source licensing, and select compatible licenses for projects.
- Demonstrate proper use of shared repositories for distributed software development and collaboration.
- Describe open source community, and demonstrate proper use of several common tools for it.
- Describe and demonstrate appropriate agile software development processes.
- Describe and demonstrate the contribution process for open source (OS) projects.
- Describe and demonstrate issue tracking for OS projects.
- Describe and demonstrate peer review and contribution merging for OS projects.
- Describe and demonstrate continuous integration for OS projects.
- Describe and demonstrate unit testing and code coverage techniques for OS projects.
- Describe and demonstrate software container setup and use for OS projects.
