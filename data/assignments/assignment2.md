# Assignment #2 - Toolchain Candidates
ACIT3890 - BCIT - Fall 2019


## Goals for This Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is for you to work with one of the toolchain
components for an open source project, evaluate it in the context
of CodeIgniter, and make a pitch for integrating it into
CodeIgniter's workflow. 

This assignment can be done individually or as a team of two.
If there is a team brave enough to tackle Kubernetes, that can be a team of three.
