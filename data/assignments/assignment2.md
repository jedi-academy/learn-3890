# Assignment #2 - Small-medium Contribution
ACIT3890 - BCIT - Fall 2019


## Goals for This Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is for you to work with one of the tools
in an open source project, or to build a supporting tool/script. 

This can be a team of two or three.

## Assignment Topics

The class has not seemed enthusiastic about a class project/repo etc.
Accordingly, I have the following suggested assignment topics,
related to the CodeIgniter 4 project:

- upgrade the documentation tool from Sphinx 1.4.5 to Sphinx 3.0
    - Python needs to be bumped to v3;
    - user_guide_src needs readme, makefile and source/conf.py updated
    - admin/ needs docbot updated
    - all needs testing; it must still work
- tool to build or suggest FAQ entries from forum
    - chatbot opportunity?
- forum moderator tool (team of 3)
    - identify spammers, suspect users, self-promo users
    - could be stand-alone or forum plugin
    - needs UI
- tool to cleanup forum data (1GB)
    - remove unused avatars, propose dead users to drop, remove unused attachments
    - needs UI
- tool to convert the CodeIgniter 3 wiki to forum threads (team of 3?)
    - so that we can remove the wiki
    - could be stand-alone or forum plugin

Teams will have to split up the work, and hence the PRS, so that each member
ends up with credit in the repositories, some of which might be new.
