# Assignment #2 - Small-medium Contribution
ACIT3890 - BCIT - Fall 2019


## Goals for This Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is for you to work with one of the tools
in an open source project, or to build a supporting tool/script. 

This can be a team of two or three.

## Assignment Topics

The class has not seemed enthusiastic about a class project/repo etc.
Accordingly, I have the following suggested assignment topics,
related to the CodeIgniter 4 project:

- upgrade the documentation tool from Sphinx 1.4.5 to Sphinx 3.0
    - Python needs to be bumped to v3;
    - user_guide_src needs readme, makefile and source/conf.py updated
    - admin/ needs docbot updated
    - all needs testing; it must still work
- tool to build or suggest FAQ entries from forum
    - chatbot opportunity?
- forum moderator tool
    - identify spammers, suspect users, self-promo users
    - could be stand-alone of forum plugin
- tool to cleanup forum data (1GB)
    - remove unused avatars, drop dead users
- security audit
    - not for the faint of heart, hehe
