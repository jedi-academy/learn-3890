#Assignment #2/3 - DRAFT RESTful Backend DRAFT
COMP4711 

## Assignments Overview

The purpose of the assignments, collectively, is to have you apply the techniques 
from the lessons and tutorials, in a context that will be helpful to you
when you build your project next term. 
In your option project teams (of three to five), you will be building a small 
but complete RESTful backend webapp. 

This was to be done in three stages, but you were not ready for stage two,
so stages two & three get bundled here.

You are free to use the programming language and framework of your choice to implement
these, bearing in mind that assistance for non-CodeIgniter projects will
be spotty, and you may have to explain how your project achieves the assignment goals.

## Goals for This Assignment

The purpose of this assignment #2 is to provide a RESTful resource and a RESTful
service, with a front-end suitable for exercising them. 

This was to be for your option project, but that needs to be revisited. ??


## Recipe

Here is a checklist for completing the assignment:

- You have your team and repo
- You have a project, right? with one or two plausible resources, 
    and one or two plausible API usecases/groups
- You need real data for your resources (eg MySQL database), with non-trivial data 
    (4-8 fields per record, 6-12 records in all)
- For each resource, have a resource routing to a resource controller...
    - which uses the equivalent of the API response trait
    - implements all methods of ResourceController
- For each API endpoint, a suitable controller implementing the API
- Make it testable - here's where the exercising front-end comes in.
    It should look like the kind of project you are building
    - could be Javascript & AJAX; could be forms submitted
    - doesn't have to be home or landing page, but could be
- Follow good gitflow workflow
- Cleanup
    - readme, changelog?, commented code!, cruft gone, all synched

## Assignment submission
