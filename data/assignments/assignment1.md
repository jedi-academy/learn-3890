# Assignment #1 - Managed Contribution
ACIT3890 - BCIT - Fall 2019


## Goals for This Assignment

The purpose of this assignment have you demonstrate proper contribution to
a live (public) open soruce project, albeit in a sheltered fashion. 

## Assignment Overview

The [CodeIgniter website](https://codeigniter.com/en/home) stems from a 
[repository](https://github.com/codeigniter4projects/website2) within
the CodeIgniter project. It has hooks in place for localization,
i.e. rendering of the pages in any of the "provided" translations.

The only locale "provided" out-of-the-box is English, and that is where
you come in :)

All messages are in language-specific files, inside an appropriate folder
(named with the ISO-639-1 locale code) of `app/Language`.

You are to translate one or more message sets, for a locale to
be negotiated in class. The target is roughly 100 lines
per student. You are welcome to do more, but it is not expected.

Follow gitflow workflow (forking, branching), with GPG-signed commits
and meaningful commit/PR titles.

As contributions get merged, the [testing website](https://website2.codeigniter.com/) will be
updated, so you can see the effect of your work.

Once the assignment is over, the translations will end up going live,
with the new locales added by you. Your names may also show up on 
the [official site](https://codeigniter.com/en/contribute), in the acknowledgements!
