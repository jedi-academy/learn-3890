#Assignment #1 - Accessorize
COMP4711 - BCIT - Winter 2018

##Assignments Overview

The purpose of the assignments, collectively, is to have you apply the techniques 
from the lessons and tutorials.
In teams of three to five, you will be building a small but complete webapp, 
in our case to accessorize the gear for a person or vehicle. 

This will be done in two stages, with specific expectations for each stage. 
The second assignment will build on the first one.

The framework and a number of supporting technologies have been pre-decided. 
The techniques for applying these will be the subject of upcoming lessons and tutorials.

##Goals for This Assignment

The purpose of this assignment #1 is to get the basic pieces of your webapp 
in the correct places expected for a CodeIgniter webapp.

The important thing here is to get the right pieces in the right places.
You will add proper functionality "behind" the components in the next assignment.
