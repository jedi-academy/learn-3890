		The items in this lesson are not routing or its configuration, per se,
		but they are techniques that affect the outcome from handling
		a request.

    <slide title="1. Hooks" layout="normal" tag="tag1">
        <p>Hooks let you inject logic at different points in the
        lifecycle of request handling.</p>
        <p>Hooks are not necessarily events, but could be implemented using that
        technique.</p>
     </slide>
     
    <slide title="Hook Points" layout="normal">
        <p>The following are the "hook points" that you can use in CodeIgniter:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>pre_system</li>
            <li>pre_controller</li>
            <li>post_controller_constructor</li>
            <li>post_controller</li>
            <li>display_override</li>
            <li>post_system</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hooks are configured similarly to routes, and you can have
            multiple hooks for the same hook point.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Adding Hooks" layout="normal">
        <p>Configure your hooks in <code>application/config/hooks</code></p>
        <p>An example:</p>
        <p>
            <code>$hookie = array(<br/>
            &#160;&#160;'class'=&gt;..., <br/>
            &#160;&#160;'function'=&gt;..., <br/>
            &#160;&#160;'filename'=&gt;..., <br/>
            &#160;&#160;'filepath'=&gt;..., <br/>
            &#160;&#160;'params'=&gt;...<br/>
                );</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>$hooks[entrypoint][] = $hookie;</code>
        </p>
        <p>"entrypoint" would be one of the "hook points", eg. "post_system".</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Uses for Hooks" layout="normal">
        <p>Some uses of hooks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>pre_controller: choose from one of several possible databases,
            hiding this from the controller</li>
            <li>post_controller: free up resources or cleanup session, if
            those would normally wait for garbage collection</li>
            <li>post_controller_constructor: build a menu selection
            array based on time of day or some other criteria not relevant to the controller</li>
            <li>display_override: inject glossary tooltips for words
            in a pre-defined list</li>
        </ul>
    </slide>

     <slide title="2. Remapping On the Fly" layout="normal" tag="tag2">
         <div class="left">
       <p>Separate from any routing rules, a controller itself can
        affect the handling of an incoming request, through
        a <code>_remap</code> method.</p>
        <p>The _remap method lets you overwrite the normal 
            behaviour for controller methods. If your controller has
        this method, it is always called.</p>
         </div>
        <div class="right">
        <p>An example which hides the real name of a method:<pre><code>
public function _remap($method, $parms=array() ) {
    if ($method == 'work') $this->guessMeIfYouCan($parms);
    else return call_user_func_array($method,$parms);
}
		</code></pre>
		By the way, the <code>work</code> method would have to exist, in order
		for routing to succeed; this remapping causes different, and perhaps
		non-obvious code, to be executed in its place.
		</p>
        </div>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Remapping for Localization" layout="normal">
         <div class="left">
        <p>Remapping could also be used to handle having a language code 
            between the domain name and
            the "normal" part of a URL, for instance
            "https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop".</p>
         <p>This way, URLs have the form <code>/idiom/class/method/parm1/...</code>,
         where "idiom" is a language identifier.
        </p>
         </div>
        <div class="right">
			<p>The original URL is problematic because the language idiom
			is in the position where a controller name would normally be found.
			The first thing we need to do is swap the order of the first
			two segments.</p>
		<p>To redirect the example above to "/library/en-us/windows/desktop",
			you need a routing rule to swap the idiom and the intended controller: <br/>
            <code>$routes['(:any)/(:any)/(.+)'] = '$1/$0/$2';</code></p>
        </div>
          
    </slide>

    <slide title="Remapping Continued" layout="normal">
         <div class="left">
        <p>Now that the correct controller is being called, we have to deal
			with the issue that the segment following the controller name
			is a language idiom, not a method name. 
        </p>
            <p>We can do that, in your <code>Library</code> controller or base controller, by
			adding a <code>_remap</code> method, like that shown to the right.</p>
            <p>That method would handle <code>/fr/find/apple</code>
                by calling <code>Find::apple(...)</code> with the <code>fr</code>
                translations loaded.</p>
            <p>See the <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/controllers.html?highlight=remap#remapping-method-calls" 
                       target="_blank">user guide</a> for more details.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
				<p>
				<pre>
				<code>
public function _remap($method, $parms=array() ) {
    $idiom = $method; // the alleged method is really an idiom
    $this->lang->load('translations_for_this_controller',$idiom);
    $real_method = array_shift($parms); // grab &amp; remove first
    return call_user_func_array($real_method,$parms);
}

    <slide title="3. Loose Ends" layout="normal" tag="tag3">
        <p>How you handle requests is ultimately an application
			design issue. It can be complicated in a few ways, as noted below.
        </p>
		<ul>
			<li>It is *possible* to enable and use query strings
			in URIs for CodeIgniter webapps, but it is strongly
			discouraged ... so much so that I'm not
			providing a link to the user guide page describing it.</li>
			<li>Routing can be database-driven, sort of. The problem is that
			routing is done before a controller is invoked and a database can be
			checked. This could be handled through remapping, where a
			request is redirected based on something retrieved from a DB.
			It could also be done inside the normal handler for some
				functionality, which would use the <code>redirect(...)</code>
			function from the URL helper, perhaps after some initial
			data-driven processing.</li>
		</ul>

    </slide>

    <slide title="Service Routing" layout="normal">
        <p>"Service" routing can be awkward as well...
        </p>
		<ul>
			<li>A RESTful service uses HTTP verbs as part of its "routing",
			and it expects automatic data format conversions, incoming
			and outgoing. This is beyond conventional routing, and
			will be discussed in its own lesson (week 12?)</li>
			<li>Many external services, and enterprise ones as well,
			provide a callable API to consuming processes. In such a case, it
			is common to have "api/" as the first part of a URI,
			but interpretation of the balance of the URI might be
			supplier-specific. You might have to use several
			of the routing techniques in combination.</li>
		</ul>
