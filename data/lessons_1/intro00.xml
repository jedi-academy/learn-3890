    <slide title="Deviating from Normal ..." layout="normal">
        <p>A few things are different in this course, compared to what
            you might be used to...</p>

            <li>Flipped Learning</li>
            <li>Flipped LMS</li>

    <slide title="Flipped Learning" layout="normal">
        <p>Weekly readings will be assigned, starting with the second week, 
            following somewhat of a "flipped" learning model. </p> 
        <p>You then have the opportunity to complete a D2L survey, 
            by the evening before that week's lecture,
            providing questions to answer in class. 
            This gives me a chance to adjust the lecture, 
            and to address issues important to you.
        </p>
        <p>This is not a fully "flipped" model, which would have the lectures
            totally online, and which would have face-to-face sessions be seminars only.</p>

    <slide title="Flipped LMS" layout="normal">
        <p>Desire2Learn (D2L) is a very comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS).</p>
        <p>It is both flexible and inflexible at the same time, and expects content
            to be re-expressed inside its awkward &amp; clunky confines.</p>
        <p>A flipped LMS, on the other hand, lives independently of D2L, and is
            whatever suits the tech-savvyness of the instructor. These are typically
            open-source, flat file driven, and stored/collaborated on, using
            an online repository.</p>

    <slide title="GIT Repositories" layout="normal">
        <p>Throughout this lab, and indeed this course, frequent mention is made of
            "github repositories". The course hub, and *all* of the starter and example projects
            are stored on github.com.</p>
        <p>
            <b>This is an off-campus resource, and the BCIT privacy policies
                apply.</b>
        </p>
        <p>Your work is to be completed in a public GIT repository,
            but you have choices for this:
            <ul>
                <li>Use github.com voluntarily, possibly with an alias account name
                    if you have privacy concerns</li>
                <li>Use git.cit.bcit.ca, a Gitlab server on campus</li>
                <li>Use bitbucket.com or the GIT server of your choice</li>
            </ul>
        </p>        
        <p>Whenever you read the term "github repository" in connection
            with your work, interpret that as whatever *public* GIT repository you are using!</p>
