#Week 12 Survey Results	
	
Responses for the survey follow, with the number of similar
responses shown to the right of a response.
	
There were 28 responders.
	
I have interpreted and aggregated some of the results, in hopefully an appropriate fashion.  
I have bolded what I consider the important takeaways.  

An observation I would make is that the questions were pretty much all over
the map - there were not a few topics that stood out.
