#Week 4 Survey Results

Responses for each of the surveys follow, with the number of similar
responses denoted by a value in brackets, if appropriate.

I have interpreted and aggregated results, in hopefully an appropriate fashion.

###What controller topics from the lesson do *you* feel need more or better explanation?			

- Service Controller	4 _Lab this week :)_
- Template Parser	4 _Week 6_
- CI_Controller and its purpose	3 _In class demo_
- Drivers	3  _Adapters for supported native session or database libraries._
- Routing	3 _Class & lab this week_
- Demo	2 _In class_
- good controller design	2 _Use the usecase force, Luke_
- handling ajax requests	2 _Service controller_
- Pages Controllers: is it better to have 1 controller per page or many pages per controller?	2 _Sure_
- Segment Based Naming	2 _In class_
- A 'real world' example of a driver?	_In class demo_
- Can template parsers be used to substitute code? if so, is it recommended?	 _No. Sorta. Hacky. Ask me in lab!_
- Comparison between Controller in MVC and ViewModel in MVVM	_Controller in MVC handles HTTP requests, 
whereas MVVM says it's a good idea to have a widget (V) with localized
"controller" kinda stuff for event handling, and some state info
for what the widget is presenting (VM).  
This is often called MVC2, and is typical of Java Swing components._
- Configuration Stuff	_Demo_
- Controller's constructor. E.g. parent __controller();	 _Demo_
- DB Connections	_Week 5_
- Debug vs Release Configurations	_Week 5_
- Dependency Injection	_Demo_
- difference and relationship with model	 
_Association, not aggregation: controller uses models, models unaware
of controllers, only models to access RDB_
- Difference between codeigniter & other frameworks	 _See organizer_
- Extending helpers	_Week 9_
- Getting Input Other Ways	_In class_
- How to use utility controllers	_Lab this week_
- http responses and redirects	_Yes??_
- In the template parser example, is the blah inside parse('blah',$params); the view name?	_Yes_
- library stuff	_?? As in what libraries are there? how to write your own? Week3 (basic01-ci) or week 9_
- More detail on how the controller gets info	_In class_
- more visualized code example, including how controllers cooperate with other files, will be helpful	 _Demo_
- MVC Uses	_Usecase realization_
- public vs private methods in controller	 _Demo_
- Relationship / how it affects models	  
_Association, not aggregation: controller uses models, models unaware
of controllers, only models to access RDB_
- Relationship / how it affects views	  
_Association, not aggregation: controller uses views, views unaware
of controllers, and ideally unaware of models too_
- Repository Pattern	_Week 5_
- Returning an Action Result	_Unclear - I don't mention Action Results. Ask me in lab?_
- Revisited	_This is what any controller's handling should do ... a recap_
- security	_Yes?_
- Should data queries be the job of a controller or a model?	_Model!!!!!!_
- Since the URL can be resolved in different ways, what is CI suposed to do if an URL can matches multiple rules?	
_In class_
- URL format about controller	 _In class_
- What exactly are view parameters	_Associative array indices which get instantiated
as local variables when a view is processed._
- when you use Input class to get form data, is this data sanitized?	_Yes_
