I have interpreted and aggregated some of the results, in hopefully an appropriate fashion.
Thank you to those who responded :)
	
##WEEK 12 â€“ REST
	
###What are topics from the lesson that *you* feel need more or better explanation?	
	
- Microservices	5  
_Hmmm - this is just a distributed component packaging philosophy,
which suits the cloud._
- Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)	5 _In class demo_
- Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)	4  
_RPC with service endpoint lookup.
Typified by Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), which is considered
bloated and out of favor._
- REST in CodeIgniter	3 _In class & lab_
- REST Implementation	2 _In class & lab_
- Do we need to install any libraries to set up CodeIgniter RESTful Server?	 _In class & lab_
- How does Restful incooporate with database, eg MySQL?	 _In class & lab_
- How to achieve unity in the midst of all these different implementations	_Good luck_
- I'm a little bit confused on what you mean by "data strctures"	
_Whatever data you need to pass between apps_
- JSON-REST	 _In class & lab_
- resst issues and problems	 _In class & lab_
- REST Api explanation	_There is no REST API!_
- REST URLs	_Whatever you want them to be :-/_
- restful routing	_One way to redirect incoming requests.
Different frameworks might do it differently._
- RESTful standards	_None, just a philospphy :(_

	
###Are there other, related, questions that you would like addressed in class?	
	
- are there any equivalent philosophies to REST in the industry?  _In class_
- Are there any upcoming trends that might replace REST _IMHO, no_
- Are there other alternatives to REST?  
_XML-RPC, SOA, platform/language specific packages (eg RMI)_
- Client Server connections _Yes...? let me count the ways..._
- What is SOAP (mentioned in the SOA diagram) and what is the relationship between them?  
_Early implement of SOA, with stricter server & data specification._
- When to use RPC over SOA   
_SOA can be thought of as a superset of RPC,
with explicit provision for locating services. That could be done with RPC
using subdomains._

Hmmm ... XML-RPC is like a Jeep, SOA(P) is like a highly automated luxury car,
and REST is like a DIY car, built from kits or parts that claim to fit together :)
