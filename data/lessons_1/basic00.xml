		<p>This mini-presentation addresses some of the assumptions about webapps,
			and provides a bird's eye view of CodeIgniter, which
			is more completely introduced in week 2's regular lesson.</p>
		<p>We ran out of time the first week, but I didn't want this to fall between the cracks!</p>

	<slide title="Web Tier Basics" layout="normal">
		<p>The simplest view of a web server is that it is a web-tier contoller,
			responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests.</p>
		<p>Some of these requests are for publically visible files, and those 
			can be just "returned" to the web client.</p>
		<p>Other requests involve application logic, and the web server
			would then determine which application component(s) to request
			service from, and format the results of that for presentation
			to the web client.</p>

	<slide title="Web Server Basics" layout="normal">
		<div class="left">
			<p>A richer view of a web server suggests that it is itself a framework.</p>
			<p>Incoming requests are encapsulated, as are the responses.</p>
			<p>Developers use a framework running on the web server.
				It provides an API for developers to build web components,
				and to access data stored locally or on its own server.</p>
