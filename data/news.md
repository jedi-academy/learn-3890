**Final exam**  
The final exam & solution (both variations) have been posted on D2L.

There were a few questions about the solution, with the following results:

Question OOO#37 and XXX#2 have an incorrect answer. The correct one should be "c" for OOO and "b" for XXX.
This answer is the only well-formed XML.

Question #56 for both OOO and XXX was incorrectly worded - the closing `<cast>` should have read `</cast>`.
The question contained invalid XML, and would not have resulted in a SimpleXMLElement :(
I will remove that question altogether.
