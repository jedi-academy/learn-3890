## Week 7 - Feb 26

Entities- who needs them?

## Week 6 (real) - Feb 21

Models, models, models

## Week 6 - Feb 12

Snow day :(

## Week 5 - Feb 5

We have some work to do on routing & responding,
paying attention to case sensitivity & what works.

You should start on assignment 1, if you haven't already done so.

## Week 4 - Jan 29

Controllers and routing, woohoo!

UPDATES:

- Some of the students are encountering "Whoops" error messages when testing
their backend, even though their code looks reasonable. I am investigating.
- It has become apparent that the CI4 User Guide section on routing isn't
as helpful as it should be, and I am working on that too.

### "Office Hours"

Some of you were asking about office hour availability, as our schedules don't seem to mesh well.
I am happy to set up a D2L virtual classroom instance, or a zoom video conference,
to answer any questions. This can be done at a mutually agreeable time.
