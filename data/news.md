**Lab 1 note**  

In the "DocumentRoot" element of Apache's configuration file (`httpd.conf`), the
AllowOverride setting needs to be `AllowOverride All`, if yours came with it
set to `None`. I should have mentioned this in the writeup, sorry.

**"Office Hours"**

Some of you were asking about office hour availability, as out schedules don't seem to mesh well.
I am happy to set up a D2L virtual classroom instance, or a zoom video conference,
to answer any questions. This can be done at a mutually agreeable time.
