Materials posted.

**_Http Authentication error?_**  
A number of Windows-using students
reported getting an "HTTP authentication failed" error whenever they pushed
to their repo in lab today, and they had to re-enter their credentials.
Bottom line ... Github updated their credential strength a few days ago,
dropping support for TLSv1.
Windows users may need to update their Windows Credential Manager
or even re-install the newest Git client (version 2.14.3 IIRC).
Alternately, github.com suggests removing and re-adding your keys on github.com,
and possibly doing the same in your local keystore.
