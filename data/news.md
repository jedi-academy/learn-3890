**Week 12**  
The material was posted last week. No changes.

Lab period this week will be used to help you work on your assignment.

**Week 13** 
Next week, I plan to say a few words about authentication, and provide a review.

Of potential interest, I link to some tutorial material on building a RESTful
client & server, with role-based-access-control. This is optional!

I suggest that you try last term's final exam, for practice, and ask for any
needed clarificaiton during the lab period.

**Week 14**  
Final exam! Weds Apr 18, 12:45-14:15 in SW01-1205
