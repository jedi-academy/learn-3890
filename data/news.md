## Week 4 - Sept 25

We are looking into governance and community this week.

Governance refers to the decision making in a project (eg choosing features),
and there are only two fundamental models for it. 
Read the [OSS Watch briefing](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/governancemodels),
and then complete the governance survey on D2L.

"Community" is another matter altogether, and that's what we will explore in class :)

Assignment #1 has been posted in the week 6 tab, when it is due.

## D2L Content

I decided that some of the lab submissions, that I wanted to share, were best
done on D2L rather than publicly or on Slack. I have created a couple of "content modules"
for this purpose.
