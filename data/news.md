**Week 10**  
Week 10 materials & lab 8 posted.

I added some notes about unit testing, in the supplementary section of the
organizer, for those interested.

**Planning**  
Lab 8 will be the last "regular" lab.  
We will spend the next two weeks helping you with assignment 2.
Its writeup is in draft form, and should be finalized tonight.  
Week 13 will have lab to address questions you have, in particular
about last term's final exam.

There have been a few questions come up about this week's lab, and I have collected
them in a `lab08faq     ` in the week 10 section of the organizer.
