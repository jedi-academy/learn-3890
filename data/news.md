## Week 3 - Sept 18

We will be tackling source code management this week, specifically the
collaborative workflow that is essential to teamwork. 

Before class, please [setup your GPG keys](https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-commit-signature-verification) 
for signing git commits. This is the standard way to identify your contributions in a
team project. You will need the [GnuPG tool](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html) installed for this.

Take a look at Atlassian's [introduction to collaborative workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows).
Don't worry if it doesn't all "stick" - I have my own presentation to share
with you at the beginning of class, which parallels this week's lab.

The profiles submitted for lab 1 have been collected into a worksheet, accessible in the week 1 tab.

The lab 2 submissions have been collected into a case study writeup, accessible in the week 2 tab.

## Week 4 - Sept 25

We are looking into governance and community this week.

Governance refers to the decision making in a project (eg choosing features),
and there are only two fundamental models for it. 
Read the [OSS Watch briefing](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/governancemodels),
and then complete the governance survey on D2L.

"Community" is another matter altogether, and that's what we will explore in class :)

Assignment #1 has been posted in the week 6 tab, when it is due.
