## Week 3 - Jan 22

We're going to take a shallow dive into MVC and what a framework does for you :)

### Week 2 - Jan 15

I am swapping the planned lesson order (2 and 3), so that we can focus on just
the one thing this week: collaborative workflow. We want a solid base moving forward.

Some of you were asking about my availability for office hours or consultation...
I am willing to give D2L's virtual classroom a go, this Thursday (Jan 17),
from 13:30-14:30. Join me through the D2L link, and we'll see how it works :)

**Added some FAQ notes in the week 2 tab**

### Lab 1 note  

In the "DocumentRoot" element of Apache's configuration file (`httpd.conf`), the
AllowOverride setting needs to be `AllowOverride All`, if yours came with it
set to `None`. I should have mentioned this in the writeup, sorry.

### "Office Hours"

Some of you were asking about office hour availability, as our schedules don't seem to mesh well.
I am happy to set up a D2L virtual classroom instance, or a zoom video conference,
to answer any questions. This can be done at a mutually agreeable time.
