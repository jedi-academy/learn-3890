## Week 3 - Sept 17

We will be tackling source code management this week, specifically the
collaborative workflow that is essential to teamwork. 

Before class, please [setup your GPG keys](https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-commit-signature-verification) 
for signing git commits. This is the standard way to identify your contributions in a
team project. You will need the [GnuPG tool](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html) installed for this.

Take a look at Atlassian's [introduction to collaborative workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows).
Don't worry if it doesn't all "stick" - I have my own presentation to share
with you at the beginning of class, which parallels this week's lab.
