## Week 4 - Sept 25

We are looking into governance and community this week.

Governance refers to the decision making in a project (eg choosing features),
and there are only two fundamental models for it. 
Read the [OSS Watch briefing](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/governancemodels),
and then complete the governance survey on D2L.

"Community" is another matter altogether, and that's what we will explore in class :)

Assignment #1 has been posted in the week 6 tab, when it is due.

## Week 5 - Oct 2

We will be working with agile development & its integrations this week.

As prep, refresh your knowledge of agile project management.

Suggested:  [Project Management 101](https://zapier.com/learn/project-management/project-management-systems/)  
If pressed for time: [Beginnersâ€™ Guide to Agile](https://www.workfront.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-agile-project-management-methodology)

The terms you want to be up on: release, sprint, icebox, backlog, scrum, burndown, velocity

## D2L Content

I decided that some of the lab submissions, that I wanted to share, were best
done on D2L rather than publicly or on Slack. I have created a couple of "content modules"
for this purpose.

## Assignment Details

Suggested topics ... see tabs for weeks 10 & 14

## Lab 5 Help

I have put some NOTES together for you, to help with the issues encountered trying to complete it.
It is in the week 5 tab.

Ask additional questions or raise any issues on slack, thanks!

## Week 7

I sense a lack of enthusiasm for the proposed assignment topics, and
that you are itching to get into the toolchain. So be it.

I will revise the organizer later today, but we will dive into
CI/CD tomorrow, with a revised assignment 2 topic list that I hope
will grab you more.

So, formal details of the course schedule change tomorrow.

In prep, I suggest you read the Atlassian article, 
[CI vs CD vs CD](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/continuous-integration-vs-delivery-vs-deployment).
