Note: I fixed the link for the authentication tutorial, part of week 13, for those interested.

The REST lab is an EXAMPLE only, for those students interested. Nothing has to be handed in!

**Week 13** 
I plan to say a few words about authentication, and provide a review.

Of potential interest, I link to some tutorial material on building a RESTful
client & server, with role-based-access-control. This is optional!

I suggest that you try last term's final exam, for practice, and ask for any
needed clarification during the lab period.

**Week 14**  
Final exam! Weds Apr 18, 12:45-14:15 in SW01-1205
