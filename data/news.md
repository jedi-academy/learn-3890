## Week 9 - Mar 19


(Yes, the week numbers are a bit messed up, with spring break and the earlier snow day.)

## Week 8 - Mar 5

We're going to take a look at document databases today, and will
have time for any last minute lab 5 assistance.

## Week 7 - Feb 26

Entities- who needs them?

**Update**: This is [the repo](/download/playful.zip) we built in class today, as far as we got.
I will complete it later this evening, and maybe tidy it up a bit  so I am
not as embarrassed by the UI (or lack thereof).

## Week 6 (real) - Feb 21

Models, models, models

### "Office Hours"

Some of you were asking about office hour availability, as our schedules don't seem to mesh well.
I am happy to set up a D2L virtual classroom instance, or a zoom video conference,
to answer any questions. This can be done at a mutually agreeable time.
