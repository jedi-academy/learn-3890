## Week 8 - Oct 24

Just a reminder - this week's lecture will be online, Thurs 13:30, to accommodate midterms.

Good luck in your midterms :)

## Week 9 - Oct 30

And our final course correction: weeks 9-12 each focus on a different CI/CD toolchain.You are to complete any
three of them, except one you are not eligible for as it overlaps/conflcts with your assgnment 2.

Assignment 2 remains unchanged - investigate a tool in sufficient depth to provide  a recommendation
or not sbout integrating it into CodeIgniter 4's existing toolchain.

Assignment 3 is unchanged - integrae a negotiated component into the ch-4 toolchain.

## Week 10 - Nov 5

Assignment 2 presentations, woohoo!

The booked meetings are shown in the slack channel.
I will post zoom links for each once we get underway.
I expect the presenting team members to be there - classmates are welcome to sit in

## Week 11 - Nov 13

Presentation & pitch day, in class. 
We may have a guest attending online :)

## Weeks 10-12 ... CI tutorials

The CI tutorials for labs 7, 8 & 10 have not worked out as planned.
Trying to complete them ends up in a roadblock, typically with
a cloud or active directory permissions problem that is not
easily worked around :(

Lab 9, the Laravel & Buddy CI tutorial, initially failed with a PHP
fatal error because of a missing `vendor` folder. That is resolved
with `composer update --no-scripts`, so the tutorial can be completed.
So, lab 9 is a go!

Don't worry about the other messed up tutorials (7, 8 & 10).

## Weeks 12-14 - Nov 20-Dec 4

We have three weeks to complete assignment 3, a toolchain contribution
for a live open source project.
